Lucky are those few, like us, who unknowingly earned numerous unconditional friends, during our own 4 year epic saga of this great institution, back in 2003 – 2007. Most of our grown-up daily lives revolve around eventual interests, involving provisional friends, colleagues & strangers. All they question is how useful am I, for their own interests; apart from our beloved ones. By fighting this cruel professional world with inclined interests, gradually, we lose our innocence. This innocence is that X factor, which used to award us such unconditional friends, at this utopian world of Jolu, somewhere down the evergreen alleys of our memory lanes. For every passing-out grown-up Joluites, this unforgiving Real World is waiting to greet them, equipped with never ending competitions, demands & targets. We work hard, here in this Real World, for the rest of our lives, without encountering unconditional friends, anymore. Only scarce, tiny & reasonable euphoric moments remain for us, to hold on to & to move on to, leaving the ashes of Jolu at the bottom of our hearts. As time passes, little by little, we forget the very key learning from our hostel heydays - I am happy, without any reason, just because it’s natural state of my mind. The sole cause of this scholarship is to honor the virtue of unconditional friendship & to encourage our junior counterparts towards this very culture that makes us Joluites unique, by every means of humanitarian ethics & nobility. For the recipients of this scholarship & his/her mates, all we can say is - Good Luck. Please don’t forget, you carry a legacy of true friends. It will help you to sail through the ocean of Life.

Now-a-days, we see a lot of decoration arts like Rangoli & Kolam sweeping digital media, duly corrected by all means of Artificial Intelligence. Back in early 2000s, we were spellbound by the sheer brilliance of Partha & his exceptional art of ALPANA, purely produced by artistic skills of Natural Intelligence. His elated sense of perfection in mirroring shapes & repeating patterns, sketched gigantic & extravagant Alpana, all over the auditorium & hostel common rooms, during different cultural festivals which used to mesmerize us. Isn’t Engineering all about reading patterns? Read the pattern, crack the code. We used to get lost in these mosaics & mazes, on his Alpanas, without any reason, with nothing but awestricken appreciation. He was from ECE department. After graduation, he was working at Vodafone. In 2014, during a tower visit near Pune, a fatal road accident caused melancholic demise of our dear friend. It took him away from us and left only heart melting memories of him. We had an artist amongst us & we lose him just like that, within blink of an eye. He is the first person of our 2003-2007 Batch to depart from this temporary world. What an untimely & unfortunate end of a valuable mind; a mind with capability to think & produce flamboyant Alapans at ease. We all will meet someday, at the Gates of the after-world, where Partha will be waiting for us with his upgraded UHD Alpanas, to welcome us all with unconditional love, an art of lifestyle that we all learnt back in Jolu during a really unrealistic time.",

There was a need for new skill sets to cope up with the changing professional world embraced with digitalization. But there were few positive signs as well due to globalization, and the rapid expansion of information technology. We took the time as a challenge. With our sheer passion and inquisitiveness, we gradually started adopting ourselves with the highly expanding globalized world. At the same time, we always kept ourselves connected with our root. The friendship which we cherished during our golden four years at our beloved campus became stronger. JGEC experience helped us to keep ourselves distinct in the exceedingly competitive world. JGEC values taught us to be modest and honest in our all endeavour.Today, it is time to paying back to our beloved Alma Mater, JGEC. Smile 2004 Scholarship is a humble effort to encourage our future generation to excel.",

Then, after a year studying Physics Honours, I entered Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College to study Electrical Engineering in the year of 1976.  Those days the engineering courses were designed to complete by 5 years. So, in 1981, I finished my college study.  Besides participating in cricket matches, I involved myself on creation of Students Health Home initiative.  I donated Blood as and when required. I was a member of Students Union.After leaving college I worked with Mahindra Engineering & Chemical Products, then Burn Standard, Howrah Works.  I left Burn to join Siemens India – Rourkela office. After working for 2 years I came back to Siemens Calcutta Office. I stayed and worked at this office for 10 more years before immigrating to Canada. While working at Calcutta I went and lived in West Germany for more than 2 years. In Canada the engineering profession is very strictly regulated. So, I became a Professional Engineer of Ontario, Canada.  I worked with Hatch Associates Ltd and then with Siemens Canada. After 6 and half years living in Canada I immigrated to Florida, United States. I have been living 20 years in Florida.  I have been working at Siemens USA and expect to work some more years.I am married and have a son and a daughter.  I went back to visit my college in the year of 2009.  I come to visit my ancestral home at Kolkata once in every 2 years.",

She stood like a pillar in helping her husband to look after the poor of the villages. She used to teach the mythological subjects to the villagers & her sincerity and popularity was known beyond the boundaries. Her husband could focus on his dual work as Head master of a school & as Panchayat Pradhan (for 28 years) as full family was looked after by her. No beggar irrespective of caste, creed, religion could go out of her house without having food which she used to supervise herself. She was very much progressive in thought & action & hence left no stone unturned to see that best education was imparted to her sons & daughter within their limit. Her love touches our heart even now whenever we remember her. Her active and noble life came to an end on 5th January, 2004. ",
